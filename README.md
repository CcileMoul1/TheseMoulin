## add-ons
Other files that may help to understand the models

### [differential_system.md](https://github.com/CcileMoul1/TheseMoulin/blob/main/differential_system.md)
In this file, I describe how I build a differential system to study the growth and the metabolic behvior of a population of cells inside a reactor. This system is adaptable to different kind of reactors. In my thesis I assumed the cell population to be in a batch reactor where the extracellular metabolite concentrations are constant.

### [```initiate_path.m```](https://github.com/CcileMoul1/TheseMoulin/blob/main/initiate_pathdef.m)

Add to the path all the folders and then create [```pathdef.m```](https://fr.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/savepath.html) file to save this configuration.

## [functions](https://github.com/CcileMoul1/TheseMoulin/tree/main/functions)
All the functions or procedures to make the code works but not specific to the models.

### [```activation.m```](https://github.com/CcileMoul1/TheseMoulin/blob/main/functions/activation.m)
:warning: this function is needed by the models themself.

Returns the Michaelis-Menten ratio of an activated reaction (non-essential activation model by [Segel](https://www.google.com/search?q=ISBN+978-0-471-30309-1&client=ubuntu&hs=fOB&ei=JoaaYI2uEJuHjLsPoMi_mA0&oq=ISBN+978-0-471-30309-1&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EANQ_yhYsDdgzj1oAXAAeACAATyIAcoCkgEBNpgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwiN2dXL3cHwAhWbA2MBHSDkD9MQ4dUDCA4&uact=5)): 

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{(1%2B\frac{\beta{}}{\alpha{}K_a}A)S}{(1%2B\frac{1}{K_a}A)K_m%2B(1%2B\frac{1}{\alpha{}K_a}A)S})

#### Usage
```v = activation(S,A,Km,Ka,alpha,beta);```

```v``` is a vector of the same size as S and A containing the activated Michaelis-Menten ratio.
The parameters of this function are:
* ```S``` a vector containing the concentrations of the substrate
* ```A``` a vector containing the concentrations of the activator. :exclamation: ```A``` and ```S``` should have the same length.
* ```Km``` is the dissociation constant of the enzyme-substrate complex but could also be its Michaelis constant (these two values are often confounded) :exclamation: same unit as ```S```
* ```Ka``` is the dissociation constant of the enzyme-activator complex, also known as activation constant :exclamation: same unit as ```A```
* ```alpha``` and ```beta``` are two constants of the activation :exclamation: without unit


### [```allFluxes.m```](https://github.com/CcileMoul1/TheseMoulin/blob/main/functions/allFluxes.m)
:warning: this function is needed by solveODE and solveODE_long.

This function is thought to get all the reaction rates of a simulation (for every time) from a system similar to those I present here ie with a function that returns the reaction rates at time t as a [Map Container](https://fr.mathworks.com/help/matlab/map-containers.html). The description bellow corresponds to this point of view but this function could be used differently.

#### Usage
```fluxes = allFluxes(getFlux,T,X);```


The parameters of this function are:
* ```getFlux``` is a [function handle](https://fr.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/creating-a-function-handle.html) that uses two parameters (the function handle uses two parameters. The initial function could use more than two parameters): a positive real number t corresponding to a time and a vector x (with m elements) corresponding to the state of the system. This function returns a Map Container with the reaction rates calculated at time t and according to the vector x. It should be similar to ```flux.m``` (```param``` and ```order``` should be given in the handle. See the example).
* ```T``` is a time vector of n elements
* ```X``` is a matrix of m rows and n columns. Each column correspond to a state of the system.

```fluxes``` is a Map Container containing the same keys as the Map Container returned by ```getFlux```. When ```getFlux``` returns one element for each reaction rate (at time t, corresponding to the state x), ```fluxes``` contains the reaction rates for each time of ```T``` and the corresponding state vector of ```X```. ```fluxes(reactionName)``` is a vector such that the ith element is the reaction rate of ```reactionName``` for ```getFlux(T(i),X(:,i))```.

#### Example
```MATLAB
[T X] = ode(...) % Integration of a differential system 
fluxes = allFluxes(@(t,x) flux(t,x,param,order),T,X); %param and order are defined before
```
To have a better example, see ```solveODE.m``` and ```solveODE_long.m```.

### drawMatrix procedures

Procedures to draw curves from matrices.
All of these procedures are based on ```drawMatrix.m```.

#### [```drawMatrix.m```](https://github.com/CcileMoul1/TheseMoulin/blob/main/functions/drawMatrix.m)

Draw curves from one matrice.

##### Usage
```drawMatrix(t,x,names,color);```

* ```t``` is a vector of n elements. It is used as the abscissa vector,
* ```x``` is a matrice of n rows and m colums. Each row is used as the ordinate vector,
* ```names``` is a cell array of m strings,
* ```color``` is a string that could describe the color, the type of line, the symbol used to draw the curves. These information are used for each curves. (examples for ```color``` : ```-```, ```*```, ```-dc```...)

This procedure creates as many figures as needed. On each figure, there are 12 subplots (4 rows and 3 columns) maximum. On each of the m subplots, the curve ```(t,x(:,i))``` is drawn and its title is ```names{i}```.
By default, the drawing function is ```plot``` (linear axis) and the ```LineWidth``` is 2.

#### [```drawMatrix2.m```](https://github.com/CcileMoul1/TheseMoulin/blob/main/functions/drawMatrix2.m)

Draw curves from two matrices.

##### Usage
```drawMatrix2(t,x,t2,x2,names,color1,color2)```

* ```t``` and ```t2``` are vectors of n1 and n2 elements. They are used as the abscissa vectors,
* ```x``` and ```x2``` are matrices of n1 and n2 rows and m colums. Each row is used as the ordinate vector,
* ```names``` is a cell array of m strings,
* ```color``` and ```color2``` are strings that could describe the color, the type of line, the symbol used to draw the curves. ```color``` is used for ```(t,x)``` curves, ```color2``` for ```(t2,x2)```

Similar to ```drawMatrix``` but on each subplot, two curves are drawn : ```(t,(x(:,i))``` with ```color``` and ```(t2,x2(:,i))``` with ```color2```.

#### [```drawMatrix3.m```](https://github.com/CcileMoul1/TheseMoulin/blob/main/functions/drawMatrix3.m)

Similar to ```drawMatrix2.m``` but with 3 curves: ```drawMatrix3(t,x,t2,x2,t3,x3,names,color1,color2,color3)```

#### [```drawMatrix_.m```](https://github.com/CcileMoul1/TheseMoulin/blob/main/functions/drawMatrix_.m)

Draw curves for r matrices.

##### Usage
```drawMatrix_(ts,xs,names,colors)```

* ```ts``` is a cell array containing r vectors used as abscissa vectors,
* ```xs``` is a cell array containing r matrices of m columns. The number of rows of the matrice ```xs{i}``` is the number of element of the vector ```ts{i}```
* ```names``` is a cell array of m strings,
* ```colors``` is a cell array containing r strings.

Similar to ```drawMatrix```. On each subplot, r curves are drawn.

This function allows us to externalise the management of the variables' order in differential systems.

#### Usage
```index = getIndex(order);```

```index``` is a Map Container such that ```index(name)``` is equal to the index position of ```name``` in the Cell Array ```order```.
In other words: for ```i``` in ```[1,length(order)]```, ```index(order{i})``` is equal to ```i```.

### [```inhibition.m```](https://github.com/CcileMoul1/TheseMoulin/blob/main/functions/inhibition.m)
:warning: this function is needed by the models themself

Let the reaction rate of a reaction be ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\nu{}) when there is no inhibition and ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\nu{}i) when the reaction is inhibited. Then ```inhibition.m``` returns ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=i) which is the non-competitive inhibition model described by [Segel](https://www.google.com/search?q=ISBN+978-0-471-30309-1&client=ubuntu&hs=fOB&ei=JoaaYI2uEJuHjLsPoMi_mA0&oq=ISBN+978-0-471-30309-1&gs_lcp=Cgdnd3Mtd2l6EANQ_yhYsDdgzj1oAXAAeACAATyIAcoCkgEBNpgBAKABAaoBB2d3cy13aXrAAQE&sclient=gws-wiz&ved=0ahUKEwiN2dXL3cHwAhWbA2MBHSDkD9MQ4dUDCA4&uact=5):

### [```mapToMatrix.m```](https://github.com/CcileMoul1/TheseMoulin/blob/main/functions/mapToMatrix.m)
:warning: this function is used in scripts

Transform a [Map Container](https://fr.mathworks.com/help/matlab/map-containers.html) into a matrix.

#### Usage
```[names, matrice] = mapToMatrix(map,ordre_name);```

* ```map``` is a Map Container where each value is a row vector of size n containing numbers,
* ```ordre_name``` is an optional parameter. It is a subset of ```keys(map)``` and it fixes the order and the content of ```matrice```
* ```names``` is either ```ordre_name``` when this parameter is given or ```keys(map)``` when ```ordre_name``` is not given,
* ```matrice``` is  matrice of n columns and as many rows as there are elements in ```name```. For every i from 1 to the length of ```name```, ```matrice(i,:)=map(ordre_name{i});```



### [```mm.m```](https://github.com/CcileMoul1/TheseMoulin/blob/main/functions/mm.m)
:warning: this function is needed by the models themself

Returns the Michaelis-Menten ratio without the ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=k_{cat}E) product or ![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\nu_{max}):

![formula](https://render.githubusercontent.com/render/math?math=\frac{S}{S%2BK_m})

#### Usage
```v = mm(S,Km);```

```v``` is a vector of the same size as S containing the Michaelis-Menten ratio.

### [```myApplyFun.m```](https://github.com/CcileMoul1/TheseMoulin/blob/main/functions/myApplyFun.m)
:warning: this function is needed by solveODE and solveODE_long.

This function is thought to replace [```arrayfun```](https://fr.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/arrayfun.html). It applies the function given in parameter on every element of (T(i),X(:,i)) or (T(i),X(i,:)).

#### Usage
```res = myApplyFun(fun,T,X,dim);```

* ```fun``` is a [function handle](https://fr.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/creating-a-function-handle.html) that uses two parameters (the function handle uses two parameters. The initial function could use more than two parameters): a positive real number t and a vector x (with m elements). This function returns a **column** vector of size r (r could be 1).
* ```T``` is a vector of n elements
* ```X``` is a matrix of m rows and n columns or n rows and m columns.
* ```dim``` indicates on which dimension of the matrix ```X``` we want to apply the function: 1 for the rows ```(T(i),X(i,:))```, 2 or another value for the columns ```(T(i),X(:,i))```.
* ```res``` is a matrix containing the results of the application of ```fun``` on ```T``` and ```X```. This matrix has n rows and r columns or r rows and n columns.

When ```dim==1```, ```X``` has n rows and m columns. ```fun``` is then applied to ```(T(i),X(i,:))``` (for i in [1,n]) and ```res``` is a matrix with n rows and r columns. To sum up: ```res(i,:) = fun(T(i),X(i,:))```
When ```dim~=1```, ```X``` has m rows and n columns. ```fun``` is then applied to ```(T(i),X(:,i))``` (for i in [1,n]) and ```res``` is a matrix with r rows and n columns.  To sum up: ```res(:,i) = fun(T(i),X(:,i))```

### [saveAll.m](https://github.com/CcileMoul1/TheseMoulin/blob/main/functions/saveAll.m)
:warning: this procedure is used in scripts

Procedure to save all the open figures.

#### Usage
```saveAll(dossier,format_fig);```

This procedure saves every open figures into the folder ```dossier``` to the format ```format_fig```. If the figure has a name, this name will be the name of the file. Else, the file is named ```figure_i``` with i the number of the figure.

### [```solveODE_long.m```](https://github.com/CcileMoul1/TheseMoulin/blob/main/functions/solveODE_long.m)
:warning: this function is used in the scripts.

This function solves the differential system given in parameters or directly

#### Installation
```solveODE.m``` and ```solveODE_long.m``` use ```allFluxes.m``` and ```myApplyFun.m```.

#### Usage
```[t,x,fluxes,dxdts] = solveODE_long(x0,tf,solve,equadiff,getFlux);```

* ```x0``` is the initial condition: a vector of m elements
* ```tf``` is either the final time of the simulation (the interval of integration is then ```interval = [0 tf]```), or directly the interval of integration (```interval = tf```). 
* ```solve``` is a [function handle](https://fr.mathworks.com/help/matlab/matlab_prog/creating-a-function-handle.html) of a solver (```ode45```, ```ode15s```,...). This function handle has to take as inputs: ```system_function``` (the differential system),```interval``` (the interval of integration) and ```x0``` (the initial condition). The option used by the solver have to be defined directly in the function handle (see example bellow).
* ```equadiff``` is a function handle of the function describing the differential system. The function handle has to take two inputs: a positive number that represent the time and a vector of m elements representing the state of the system. It returns a **column** vector of m elements.
* ```getFlux``` is a function handle of the flux function. This function handle has to take two inputs: a positive number that represent the time and a vector of m elements representing the state of the system. It returns a [Map container](https://fr.mathworks.com/help/matlab/map-containers.html) that contains all the reaction rates at the state and time described by the given parameters.

* ```t``` is the column vector of n elements returned by the solver: it contains the evaluation points. If ```interval``` contains two values, then ```t``` contains the internal evaluation points used to perform the integration. If ```interval``` contains more than two values, then ```t``` is equal to ```interval```.
* ```x``` is the solution of the integration returned as matrix of n rows and m columns. Each row in ```x``` corresponds to the solution at the value returned in the corresponding row of ```t```.
* ```fluxes``` is a Map Container where ```fluxes(reactionName)``` is a vector of n elements, corresponding to the reaction rate of the reaction ```reactionName``` at every time of ```t```.
* ```dxdts``` is a matrix of n rows and m columns. The ith row in ```dxdts``` corresponds to ```equadiff(t(i),x(i,:))'```. :exclamation: ```equadiff``` returns a column vector but the results are store as rows in ```dxdts```.

#### [```solveODE.m```](https://github.com/CcileMoul1/TheseMoulin/blob/main/functions/solveODE.m)
This function is the short version of ```solveODE_long.m```. Instead of giving the solver, the differential system and the flux function in parameter, there are defined in the function (:exclamation: change the file when you want to change the system you study). ```solveODE.m``` is thought to be a shortcut for ```solveODE_long.m``` and to avoid the repetition of ```param``` and ```order``` that may lead to errors. ```solveODE.m``` is thought to be used with systems similar to the systems I present here (with ```param``` and ```order```). If your system does not use ```param``` and ```order```, prefer the use of ```solveODE_long.m```.

To use this function: ```[t,x,fluxes,dxdts] = solveODE(x0,param,order,tf);```. 

#### Example
```solveODE_long.m```:

```MATLAB
optionsode = odeset();
solve = @(ode_function,interval,x0) ode45(ode_function,interval,x0,optionsode);
equadiff = @(t,x) systeme(t,x,param,order);
getFlux = @(t,x) flux(t,x,param,order);
[t,x,fluxes,dxdts] = solveODE_long(x0,tf,solve,equadiff,getFlux);
```
```optionsode``` is an [```odeset```](https://fr.mathworks.com/help/matlab/ref/odeset.html) to define the options used by the solver.

or directly
```MATLAB
optionsode = odeset();
[t,x,fluxes,dxdts] = solveODE_long(x0,tf,@(ode_function,interval,x0) ode45(ode_function,interval,x0,optionsode),@(t,x) systeme(t,x,param,order),@(t,x) flux(t,x,param,order));
```
